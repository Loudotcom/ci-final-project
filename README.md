## Purpose of the project

Task Buddies is a to-do list website where users can create their own personal, customisable list of tasks. The purpose was to help motivate and support anyone who struggles with traditional to-do lists, and make the process of completing tasks more enjoyable. This full-stack project uses Django and Bootstrap frameworks.

# UX - User Experience

## User Stories:

 Admin
 
- As a Site Admin I can delete user accounts so that I can remove users whose content is against our content guidelines.

User   

- As a Site User I can register for the site so that I can sign in and create to-do lists.

- As a Site User I can sign in so that I can access my to-do list at any time
   
 - As a Site User I can create, read, update and delete tasks so that I can keep my to-do list updated.
 
 - As a Site User I can add a status to individual tasks so that I know which tasks are completed, which have been started and which are still to start.

 - As a Site User I can add notes to my tasks so that I remember more specific information about what I need to do.
   
## Design

Ultimately, I plan for users to be able to personalise their task list pages, including choosing a logo colour, page colour theme and a mascot.  I took one example and chose to create a tortoise sprite, a symbol of slow and steady progress, thumb up and holding a flag showing that he is rooting for the user and celebrating their wins with them. I chose a vibrant purple for the logo and footer to go with the green and brown of this mascot.

**The Logo**

- I designed this logo with the help of [Logo.com](https://www.logo.com/)'s logo generator. I liked the informal but easy-to-read font and customised it by changing the colour to a vibrant purple and adding the paw print over the 'i' of 'buddies' to reference the multiple animal mascots to be added in future iterations. I plan for the colour of the logo to be customisable by the user.

***

**Navbar**

- I kept the navbar simple, with a clean white background and the links to other pages in a standard grey font.

***

**Authorisation**

- Site users can sign up, sign in, and sign out, keeping their task lists saved for future visits.

**Mascot

![[Pasted image 20241212091324.png]]

- One of my main features/elements, and that sets my to-do list apart, is the addition of an animal mascot. I plan to introduce many animal characters that users can choose from, they could interact in some way with the user, through animation or with supportive messages.

***

**Footer

- The footer section currently has copyright information, and there are options to easily add additional links as the site grows. The colour of the footer matches the logo color to keep consistency and frame the site.

***

**Notes**

- The ability to add notes to a task would be a useful next feature, as at the moment users are restricted to the task name word limit.

**Message/Media Upon Completion**

- A valuable feature for the next iteration would be to add more of a celebration when a user completes (i.e. deletes) a task. Currently, there is a simple encouraging message above the buttons on the Delete Task page but there are many options for media or messages upon completion. As with the colour scheme and mascot, I would like this to eventually be customisable by each user individually so they make a task page that looks and interacts with them in a way that is uniquely theirs.
