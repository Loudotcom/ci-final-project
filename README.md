## Purpose of the project

Task Buddies is a to-do list website where users can create their own personal, customisable list of tasks. The purpose was to help motivate and support anyone who struggles with traditional to-do lists, and make the process of completing tasks more enjoyable. This full-stack project uses Django and Bootstrap frameworks.

# UX - User Experience

## User Stories:

 Admin
 
- As a Site Admin I can delete user accounts so that I can remove users whose content is against our content guidelines.

User   

- As a Site User I can register for the site so that I can sign in and create to-do lists.

- As a Site User I can sign in so that I can access my to-do list at any time
   
 - As a Site User I can create, read, update and delete tasks so that I can keep my to-do list updated.
 
 - As a Site User I can add a status to individual tasks so that I know which tasks are completed, which have been started and which are still to start.

 - As a Site User I can add notes to my tasks so that I remember more specific information about what I need to do.
   
## Design

Ultimately, I plan for users to be able to personalise their task list pages, including choosing a logo colour, page colour theme and a mascot.  I took one example and chose to create a tortoise sprite, a symbol of slow and steady progress, thumb up and holding a flag showing that he is rooting for the user and celebrating their wins with them. I chose a vibrant purple for the logo and footer to go with the green and brown of this mascot.
